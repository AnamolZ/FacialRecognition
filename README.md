# NeuralFacia

An advanced face recognition system implemented using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Efficiently identifies individuals in real-time video frames.
- Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for recognition.
- Supports model data persistence for faster startup times.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Face Recognition
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

### Installation

1. Repository Cloning
2. Installing the required libraries
3. Prepare your training dataset in the training_dataset directory
4. Run the script

### Usage
The system identifies individuals in real-time video frames. Recognized names are displayed on the video feed with a green label.

### Customization
Adjust the frequency, threshold, and duration parameters in the main script to suit your needs.
Customize the image_directory and model_filename paths as needed.
